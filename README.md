# Goose Chase

Goose Chase is a 2D, top-down, single-player game. You’re in an arrangement of equally sized rooms and running around somewhere is a goose, and it’s your job to find it without dying. Throughout the map, there are zombies (which can attack you, and be attacked by you); logs, which can be picked up and placed down to create walls, block entrances or provide shelter; food, which can be used to heal damage done by zombies; and other items to assist you in the game. With each level, the zombies get faster and better at finding you, and the goose gets faster and better at avoiding you. Eventually the game becomes so difficult that it’s “a wild goose chase”.
